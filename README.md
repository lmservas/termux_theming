# termux_theming
A large collection of colorschemes, patched fonts, scripts for displaying/testing colors, my termux.properties, etc..

Still a WIP as I am admittedly still learning how to write an installation script... Recently put together some great new colorschemes that I will get uploaded her soon. Also planning to remove a lot of the colorschemes that are closely related to one another or just plain ugly (also any fonts that don't function properly in Termux)
